## PyWinRT

PyWinRT is a community-supported fork of the `pywinrt` tool from the Microsoft
[xlang](https://github.com/microsoft/xlang/) project.

This repository contains both the code generation tool (`pywinrt.exe`) and the
Python bindings for the Windows SDK generated by this tool.

NOTE: Prior to September 2023, the Windows SDK bindings were generated in
a single monolithic package at https://pypi.org/project/winsdk. Moving forward,
the bindings will be generated in a modular fashion and published as separate
packages, one per Windows SDK namespace. The top level namespace has been
changed back from `winsdk` to the original `winrt`.

# pywirnt.exe

This tool is used in conjunction with [cppwinrt](https://github.com/microsoft/cppwinrt)
to generate Python bindings for Windows Runtime APIs. It can be used with the
Windows SDK and with custom components.

A pre-compiled binary version of the PyWinRT tool is available via [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PyWinRT).
